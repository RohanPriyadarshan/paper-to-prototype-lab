## Detection Capabilities

✅ **Can Detect:**
- Fungal diseases (blights, spots, molds, rusts)
- Bacterial diseases (bacterial spots, blights)
- Viral diseases (mosaic virus, curl virus)
- Pest damage (spider mites, visible insect damage)
- Healthy plant classification

❌ **Limitations:**
- Multi-disease scenarios (plants with multiple infections)
- Early-stage infections (before visible symptoms)
- Similar-looking diseases (may require expert verification)
- Diseases not in training dataset
- Poor image quality or lighting conditions

---

## Usage Instructions

1. **Image Requirements:**
   - Clear photo of affected leaf
   - Good lighting conditions
   - Minimal background clutter
   - Focus on symptomatic areas

2. **Best Results:**
   - Upload high-resolution images (224×224 minimum)
   - Capture multiple leaves if symptoms vary
   - Include both healthy and diseased tissue
   - Avoid blurry or out-of-focus images

3. **Confidence Threshold:**
   - 95%+ confidence: Very reliable
   - 85-95% confidence: Likely accurate, monitor plant
   - Below 85%: Consider expert consultation
